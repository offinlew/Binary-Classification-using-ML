Data Test:
Given the attached labelled dataset (comprising a list of good addresses and bad addresses and their past transaction histories), build a model using supervised learning algorithms to answer the following questions:
1. Find a minimum of 10 transaction level features based on their relative importance that contribute to an address being classified good or bad.
2. Given a new wallet address and its transaction history, output a prediction score whether the address is good or bad.

The labelled dataset comprises 6 monthâ€™s (6278 addresses) worth of transaction history for 2301 bad addresses and 3977 good addresses. The dataset also details 33 transaction level features.

The model was then tested with a bad and good address along with their transaction history.
